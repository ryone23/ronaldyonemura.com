#### **About**
This repo is used to store static website created using the Hugo static site generator. As of now, my current focus is learning back-end technologies, more specifically Java. Therefore, I am using a template for my website, but when I eventually learn HTML/CSS/Javascript, I plan to redesign some aspects applying that knowledge.
