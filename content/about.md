Hello, I am Ronald Yonemura. I am an Electrical 
Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) major at 
UC Berkeley, and am currently in my junior year.

Living in the Bay Area my entire life, I have been
exposed to the one of the greatest tech hubs in the
world. The close proximity to these companies is one
of the factors that drew my interest to engineering 
and computer science at a young age. As I work towards 
completing my bachelor's degree, my goal is to pursue 
a career in the Software Engineering field, more specifically 
in full stack development.

#### **Programming Languages**

Currently, I am learning Java, but for most of my undergrad
cs courses, I used C++. I am also familiar with SQL and Python.

#### **Technologies**

I have experience with Microsoft Office and PostgreSQL.
For IDEs, I have used Intellj IDEA, Visual Studio, Eclipse,
and XCode.
