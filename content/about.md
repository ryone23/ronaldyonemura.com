Hello, I am Ronald Yonemura. I am a junior at UC
Berkeley, and my major is Electrical Engineering
and Computer Science (EECS). 

Living in the Bay Area my entire life, I have been
exposed to the one of the greatest tech hubs in the
world. The close proximity to these companies is one
of the factors that drew my interest to engineering 
and computer science at a young age. As I work towards 
completing my bachelor's degree, I hope to find an
software engineering or research internship for Summer
2021. After college, I plan to pursue a career in the 
Software Engineering field, more specifically in full 
stack development.

#### **Programming Languages**

Currently, I am learning Java, but for most of my undergrad
cs courses, I used C++. I am also familiar with SQL and Python.

#### **Technologies**

I have experience with Microsoft Office and PostgreSQL.
For IDEs, I have used Intellj IDEA, Visual Studio, Eclipse,
and XCode.
