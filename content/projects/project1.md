**Programming Language:**

Java (Java 11)

**Project Description:**

Simple Tic-Tac-Toe game that features three game modes.

1. Player vs. Player
2. Player vs. Computer
3. Computer vs. Computer

For the game modes featuring a computer, I implemented an AI
using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.
