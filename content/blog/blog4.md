While other styles of tattooing are amazing in their own right, there is something about traditional Japanese tattoos that make them my favorite. Maybe it is the classic look, or the simplicity of each piece. Maybe it is the bold blacks, greys, and colors that age well with their owner. Maybe it is the ability of each piece to tell a story. Whatever it may be, Irezumi, the Japanese word for tattoo, remains one of the more popular tattoo styles today.
