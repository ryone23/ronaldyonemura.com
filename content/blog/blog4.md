While other styles of tattooing are amazing in their own right, there is something about traditional Japanese tattoos that make them my favorite. Maybe it is the classic look, or the simplicity of each piece. Maybe it is the bold blacks, greys, and colors that age well with their owner. Maybe it is the ability of each piece to tell a story. Whatever it may be, Irezumi, the Japanese word for tattoo, remains one of the more popular tattoo styles today.

**Origins**

Tattooing in Japan dates back many centuries, where tattoos first served ritualistic/spiritualistic purposes. As time progressed, tattoos were then associated with criminals; they were a form of punishment. Irezumi didn't become what we know it as today until the Edo period.

While tattoos still marked criminals during this era, the Edo period (1600-1868 AD) marked the beginning of irezumi as an art style, something more decorative. Ukiyo-e, paintings and woodblock prints served as the basis of inspiration for these tattoos (I will go into detail on ukiyo-e art in another post).

**Modern Tattoos**

With the dawn of the Meiji period (1868-1912), Japan started on its way to becoming an industrialized nation and international power. With this came the opening of foreign relations and trade with Western countries. As a result, tattoos were prohibited in order for the country to maintain an upstanding image. 

Once again, tattoos in Japan marked criminals, but that didn't stop some artists from continuing their craft. In fact, many foreigners were intrigued and fascinated with irezumi. Tattooing would continue in an underground setting, similar to Prohibition in the United States, until being legalized in 1948.

**Tattoos Today**

Despite having been legalized for quite a while, tattoos in Japan are still controversial and are somewhat considered taboo. For example, ireuzmi is still associated with the yakuza. In fact, the top comment and thread on a {{< reddit-shortcodes/yakuza_comment >}} I read yesterday made that stereotype. Many bath houses and gyms, in Japan, will either turn away tattooed individuals or make sure they are covered up to avoid offending the other guests. 

Nevertheless, irezumi has had a significant impact on Japanese art and society. Despite all of the taboo associated with irezumi in Japan, people around the world are still captivated by its beautiful and powerful imagery. In my next post, I will discuss of the terminology and the composition of irezumi.
