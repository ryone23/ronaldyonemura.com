Seeing as I cannot currently go the gym, I thought
I would use my first fitness post to discuss where I 
was before and where I am now in my journey to get in
better shape. While I know that my process wasn't/isn't
the most efficient, I am proud in the progress I made and
motivated to keep it up.

**Background**

Despite playing baseball from the ages of 5 to 18, I have
always been one of the more unathletic (really slow and very weak)
players. On top of that, I was a bit overweight as I enjoy eating food.
What can I say? 

Once I finished playing baseball, started working, and attending community
college, I let myself go a little bit. At the end of my senior year in high
school, I think I weighed around 190 lbs. This was in 2017, and by the start of
2019, I was 215+ lbs. If I had to guess, I would say my body fat percentage
was about 26%, maybe more to be honest. You should see my current driver's license photo; I took
it in January that year. Looking back and seeing all these photos of myself from
2017-2019 makes me laugh, but at the time, I wasn't happy with where I was. 
Not only did my nutrition and lack of exercise habits affect my weight, they also
had an impact on health. I was constantly tired and usually in a sour mood. I lost
all motivation to go out with friends and do something; I usually just played
videogames.

So, like everyone does during the New Year, I decided to make it my goal to 1) Lose weight
and 2) Go to the gym consistently. However, instead of doing both at the same time and give
up in two weeks, I decided to just focus on 1 until the end of my school semester.

**Initial Weight Loss**

From January until the end of May 2019, I adjusted my eating habits by doing the following.

* Drink water only (admittedly, I did have a few beers in London)
* Cut out sugar (except the occasional cookie)
* Cut out as many carbs as I could. More specifically:
  - Chips
  - French Fries
  - Rice
  - Bread
  - Pasta
  - Potatoes
* Intermediate Fasting and skip breakfast
* Not eating until I was extremely full (meant sticking to 1-2 plates instead of 3-4)

I don't know what you think about this, but for being a part of a family that loves
to eat their food and carbs, this was very difficult for me in the first two months. I think
what helped me the most was slowly integrating each of the above every week or two. Before
I knew it, I was a little less than 180 lbs., and I haven't even started going to the gym.

**Going to the Gym**

After one of my close friends convinced me to get a membership, I finally stepped into
the gym on Memorial Day. I had no idea what I was doing the first couple weeks and was 
honestly a little embarrassed because I was still overweight and still very weak. I soon
began to figure out that that's the whole point of going to the gym, and that no one
honestly cares what you are doing. Well, unless you are screaming at the top of your lungs
or roiding out, but even then, as long as you aren't bothering anyone, youâ€™re fine. 

I started taking creatine and whey protein powder daily. My workout routine was a bro split. 
I did chest Monday, arms Tuesday, legs (barely) Wednesday,
shoulders Thursday, and back Friday. I wasn't knowledgeable with linear progression at the time, and 
while I was making noob gains, I wasn't really focused on an optimal strength building. That being said,
all I wanted to do was be consistent, and by the end of the summer I dropped to 162 and was getting stronger.

**Bulk?**

Of course, being the inexperienced I was, I thought it was time for a bulk. I knew what a bulk was, but was I ready
to increase weight each week. No, I wasn't. I just ate more food and some of the junk I was eating 
before (did I mention I love cookies?). I feel like I did get a bit stronger, but I was going about my "bulk"
all wrong. I ended up going up to 178 and started cutting again in December. 

**Second Cut**

From December 2019 to the end of June, I went on my second cut. This time, however, I was also going to the gym, 
well, at least until mid-March. Until May, I went about this cut the same way as my initial cut.
I soon discovered that I was starting to plateau around 165. I attributed this to my intermediate fasting as I would eat
bigger lunches and dinners to compensate. My fix for this was to start eating breakfast again and to be stricter with
my diet. I did an almost keto diet (I did eat fried chicken or fried fish). By July, I got as low as 145; a low I haven't 
been at since before 7th-8th grade. 

**Where I am at Now**

While I was losing weight, my body fat percentage was still fairly high; it was around 20%. After doing some research,
I found out it was because I am what they call skinny fat. Basically, I look skinny with clothes on, but I still have
a decent amount of fat on my gut, arms, and legs. Also, it means I am still pretty weak, which I am since I couldn't
increase my weight at the gym while on a cut. Therefore, once it is safe for me to go to the gym again, I will start 
as clean as a bulk as possible and focus on my new workout routing. I will go over both of these in detail in my next post.
Honestly, I don't know what my end goal is. However, after all the progress I have made 
over the past year and a half, I know for a fact that being conscious of what I eat and going to the gym are things I will
be doing for the rest of my life.
