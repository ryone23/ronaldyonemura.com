### Welcome to my blog!

With the creation of my webpage, I figure a good way to
build my online presence was to start my own blog. While this
blog will feature technical subject matter, I also want to
share many of the things I enjoy and experience, which I will
outline below. My goal is post 2-3 times a week, most during
the weekend. However, depending on the workload for school, I may
post only once or twice a week.

#### Blog Content

As of now, these are the following types of posts I will make.

&nbsp;

**School**

For these posts, I will talk about my experiences at UC
Berkeley. I will be discussing the material learned in
class. Whether that be a new concept, a review of 
ongoing assignments, or a fun/interesting fact, I will attempt 
to explain my understanding of each subject in hopes to gain a 
better grasp on the material. I hope to eventually share
gameday and other campus activity experiences. 
My goal is to be able to learn the material well enough to 
teach it and to highlight my journey through UC Berkeley life. 
These posts could also provide a look into what Berkeley life
is as a transfer student.

&nbsp;

**Projects**

A little different from the Classes posts, these posts will
focus on personal projects. For example, I am learning how
to use Spring Boot for Java with the intention to create my 
own web application soon. Can't say much more, but I have 
settled on the theme/function of my web app. The Projects
posts will discuss progress being made, challenges, and provide
peaks into what I am currently working on outside of school.

&nbsp;

**Fitness**

Over the past year and a half, I have been focusing on my
physical health with a goal of losing a lot of weight. I
still have a few pounds to go, but as the gyms slowly open
back up in my area, I plan to start a bulk in order to
gain some muscle mass and become stronger. Therefore, in 
Fitness posts, I will discuss current body measurements, 
my workout regimen, and other relevant info/stories. I 
think these posts will provide me with a good overview of 
how I am progressing in my fitness journey.

&nbsp;

**Food**

I love food. It is been very difficult for me cut a lot
of food as I work on lowering my body fat percentage.
I also enjoy cooking, and I have developed a few go-to recipes
for when I have to cook for my family. Food posts will 
discuss what I cooked (if I haven't listed it yet) or what
I have eaten and my opinion on the dishes. While these posts 
won't come as often now, as soon as I move into my own place
and experience/cook more food, I will post more often.

&nbsp;

**Japanese Art**

More specifically, I will discuss the art of irezumi, the art of
traditional Japanese tattoos. I will discuss other media in the
Japanese art, such as ukiyo-e paintings, architecture, and manga,
but there is something about the timeless look of irezumi that I
find very appealing. These posts will usually discuss a motif of
irezumi or showcase work that I find interesting. For the more
"conventional" media, I will write about the historical background,
if I can find it, and the more technical aspects of the piece of
art. Being half Japanese, the study of these media will help me
understand and appreciate my heritage.

&nbsp;

**Personal**

I will use these types of posts to discuss other things I enjoy such
as music or travel. Movies, sports (including fantasy football), and 
video games will also fall into this category. These topics could 
eventually become their own tags, but due to current circumstances, 
I don't have much to write about in any of these areas.

&nbsp;

I am excited to start this blog as a means to track my experiences
and personal growth, and my hope is that I will be consistent
throughout my journey.
